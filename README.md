# Itinerant

Welcome to Itinerant, a streamlined way to plan upcoming trips, with deep Google Maps and mobile integration. For this project I:
  + Developed a RESTful Rails backend for accessing Users and all parts of an Itinerary
  + Implemented React and Redux to create an intuitive, dynamic display integrated with Google Maps to easily plan a trip
  + Created a mobile version using React Native, with robust search features and the ability to filter by distance
  + Designed the site according to Material UI Design principles, to keep a coherent theme across the appâ€™s two platforms 
  
To get started, create an account and browse created itineraries on the home page, copy one that looks like a good starting point, or create an itinerary for a new trip. If someone else is already planning a trip that you will also be joining them on, ask them to add you as a collaborator on the itinerary page. Once you have an Itinerary started, add the cities you're thinking about visiting, as well as areas of that city to organize your travels by. Once you have a city and an area, you can start looking up attractions on the map, and adding them to your itinerary.

You can also make plans, which are meant to be rough outlines of your day. Plans are made based on city, and once added will generate a schedule at the top of your itinerary dynamically. There are also sections to add vital information like flight check-in and hotel bookings, and areas towards the bottom to add helpful information like train schedules, links to websites, etc. Have fun planning your trip!

Once you're on your trip, open up the Itinerant mobile app and log in, then find the itinerary on your profile page that corresponds to the trip you're on. Once there you can click on any attraction to open it in Google Maps, as well as search your list of attractions for any specific term, such as "Food" or "Bar" or "Zoo". You can also sort by distance while you are using the search feature.

Thanks for taking a look at my app! Let me know if you have any feature requests.
